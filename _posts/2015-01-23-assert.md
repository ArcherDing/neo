Neo provides convinient functions for dealing with errors.
You don't want to write following lines of codes every time when you want to check for error?

```Go
if err != nil {
    // do something
}
```

Neo has solution!

```Go
neo.Assert(err != nil, 400, []byte("some message"))
```

or

```Go
neo.AssertNil(err, 400, []byte("some message"))
```

or

```Go
neo.AssertNotNil(someObject, 400, []byte("some message"))
```

What does it do?
If condition is not satisfied, then Neo will return immediately to client with status code provided as second argument, and message provided as third argument.

Example:

```Go

app.Get("/somefile", func(this *neo.Ctx) {
    content, err := ioutil.ReadFile("somefile")
    neo.AssertNil(err, 404, []byte(err.Error()))

    // if file is not found, this part of code won't be called
    this.Res.Text("file found!", 200)
})
```
