Neo uses [golog](https://github.com/ivpusic/golog) for logging.

Default log level is ``INFO``, but if you want to debug Neo app and get more information what's happening under the hood, you can change log level to ``DEBUG``.

Easiest way to do this is using configuration file. It is described in <a href="{{site.url}}/tutorials/2015/01/22/configuration.html">configuration</a> section.

If you want to do it from Go, first import ``golog``.

```Go
import "github.com/ivpusic/golog"
```

Now you can change Neo's log level.

```Go
neo.Logger.Level = golog.DEBUG
```

ID of Neo logger is ``github.com/ivpusic/neo``, so possible option for changing log level is also:

```Go
logger := golog.GetLogger("github.com/ivpusic/neo")
logger.Level = golog.DEBUG
```

To disable Neo logs completely use:

```Go
golog.Disable("github.com/ivpusic/neo")
```
