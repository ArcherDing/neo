## Basics

Every time when user makes request to your Web Application, Neo will try to match one of declared routes. If none of them matches, it will return ``404``.

Neo has simple but powerful API for defining routes. When you want to declare route you have to call one of functions which corresponds to one of supported HTTP methods.
Let's define some usual GET, POST, PUT and DELETE routes.

```Go
app.Get("/article", func(this *neo.Ctx) {
    // implementation
})

app.Post("/user", func(this *neo.Ctx) {
    // implementation
})

app.Put("/image/:id", func(this *neo.Ctx) {
    // implementation
})

app.Delete("/user/:id", func(this *neo.Ctx) {
    // implementation
})
```
Every route handler should be function with **func(*neo.Ctx)** signature.

## Route parameters
In previous example for PUT route we saw ```"/image/:id"``` route path definition. Interesting part is ":id" part. This is route parameter, it is variabile part of route which can change, and you can easily get it's value.

```Go
app.Put("/image/:id", func(this *neo.Ctx) {
    fmt.Println("Updating image with id " + this.Req.Params.Get("id"))
})
```

In case that we have something like ```/user/:userid/image/:imagename``` you would get those parameters by using:

```Go
this.Req.Params.Get("userid")
// and (`Params` is actually map, so you can access it without `Get`)
this.Req.Params["imagename"]
```
