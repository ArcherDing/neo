Neo comes with CLI tool to manage your Neo application.

# Available Commands

## new
Neo can generate basic application skeleton for you.

```bash
neo new app-name
```

This will create basic Neo Web Server.

If you want create your application based on some template, you can use ``-t`` option. Currently available templates are:

* angular
* html

To make Neo application based on template run:

```bash
neo new -t template-name app-name
# example: neo new -t html myapp
```

## run
To run your application all you need to do is:

```bash
neo run main.go
```

Neo uses [go-hotreload](https://github.com/ivpusic/go-hotreload) for reruning and recompiling your application when source changes. So every time when you use ``run`` command, Neo will basically make arguments for ``go-hotreload`` tool and invoke it. You can provide options for this tool using Neo configuration file.
