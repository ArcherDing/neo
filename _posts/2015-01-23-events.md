Neo provides API for handling and emiting events. You can emit and handle your custom events too.

## Basic examples

Emit and receive events on application object.

```go
app.On("error", func(data interface{}) {
    // implementation for error handler
})
```

```go
app.Emit("someevent", eventData)
```

Emit and receive events on Context object.

```go
app.Get("/", func(ctx *neo.Ctx) (int, error) {
    ctx.On("someevent", func(data interface{}) {
        // implementation for someevent handler
    })
})
```

```go
app.Get("/", func(ctx *neo.Ctx) (int, error) {
    ctx.Emit("someevent", eventData)
})
```

Every ``Emit`` will be executed in new goroutine, so it won't block.

If you want to use events on your custom structures, you can embed ``aux.EBus`` like this:

```go
import "github.com/ivpusic/neo/aux"

type MyType struct {
    aux.EBus
    // the rest
}
```

Then your can emit and listen for events on ``MyType`` struct instances.

#### error
In case of any panics in your application, errror event will be emitted, so you will have opportunity to log panic and similar.
